# ATM-simulator
The ATM Simulator in Java is a console-based application designed to emulate the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).This project aims to reinforce key Java concepts such as user input handling, conditional statements, and maintaining account balances.

## Skills Developed

In the process of developing and working with the ATM Simulator in Java, I had the opportunity to enhance various programming skills, including:

- **Java Programming Fundamentals:** This project allowed me to strengthen my understanding of core Java concepts, including data types, variables, methods, and classes.

- **User Input and Output Handling:** I gained experience in collecting and processing user input through the console interface, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Conditional Statements and Decision-Making:** The ATM Simulator challenged me to implement decision-making logic using conditional statements, ensuring that user interactions were handled accurately.

- **Basic Account Management and Balance Updates:** Managing user accounts and updating balances for deposits and withdrawals were fundamental aspects of this project, providing practical experience in data manipulation.

These skills are essential not only for building an ATM Simulator but also for a wide range of Java programming applications. Through this project, I have expanded my proficiency in these fundamental areas of Java development.
